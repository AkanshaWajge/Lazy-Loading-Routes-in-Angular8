# Lazy-Loading-Routes-in-Angular8
With lazy loaded modules in Angular, it’s easy to have features loaded only when the user navigates to their routes for the first time. This can be a huge help for your app’s performance and reducing the initial bundle size. loadChildren expects a function that uses the dynamic import syntax to import your lazy-loaded module only when it’s needed.
